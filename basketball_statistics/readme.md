# Project Description
#### Arrayz
The purpose of this library is to have a collection of functions that can perform calculations on C arrays.
#### Basketball Stats
This program will generate a reportabout NBA basketball players, based on data that it will read in from a text file. This program uses several functions 
from the arrayz library. 
#### A simple example of what in input fileâ€™s contents could look like:
```
Devin Booker[25,5,7][27,8,5][29,5,5][28,3,10] 
James Harden[10,2,4][32,8,10][30,13,3][40,5,15]
Deandre Ayton[10,15,2][15,10,3][20,9,1][25,15,5]
Chris Paul[10,5,15][20,4,14][17,2,15][15,5,13]
```
Calculate these values for every player in the file, and as you go you should store the results for
each player into various array(s). After you have done so, you will need to determine the player the meets the
criteria for the following twelve categories:
* The most consistent scorer, rebounder, and assister (The players with lowest standard deviation in
these categories)
* The least consistent scorer, rebounder, and assister (The players with highest standard deviation in
these categories)
* The best scorer, rebounder, and assister (players with the highest average in these categories)
* The worst scorer, rebounder, and assister (players with the lowest average in these categories)
